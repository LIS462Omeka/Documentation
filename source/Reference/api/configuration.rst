Global Configuration
--------------------

Super users can configure the API using the Settings > API form.

-  Enable/disable the API (default: enabled)
-  Adjust the amount of results per page (default: 50)

API Keys
--------

All users with log in credentials can create and rescind API keys using
their Edit User form. API keys are tied to and have all the permissions
of an individual user. Super users can create keys for other users.
Treat keys as you would your password. Omeka provides the client's IP
address and the time it was last accessed.
